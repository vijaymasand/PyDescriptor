# PyDescriptorC* and PyDescriptor
In QSAR and machine learning field, molecular descriptor calculators often disappoint when it comes to deal with ease of interpretation and chirality-based descriptors. 
To solve this, we have developed PyDescriptorC* (earlier known as PyDescriptor). It computes 112,194 molecular descriptors, including 15,150 chirality-based descriptors (~13.5%) for a molecule. 
All descriptors are easy to interpret and understandable in terms of structural features. It is available from following link:
