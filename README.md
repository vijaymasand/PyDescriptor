# PyDescriptor
In QSAR and machine learning field, molecular descriptor calculators often disappoint when it comes to deal with chirality-based descriptors, and interpretation of descriptors in terms of structural features. 
To solve this, we have developed PyDescriptorC*. It computes 112,194 molecular descriptors, including 15,150 chirality-based descriptors (~13.5%). 
All descriptors are easy to interpret and understandable in terms of structural features. It is available from following link:
